# Our trip to Vietnam

Celia and I had been messing with the idea of a nice trip somewhere for summer. It was our first year living alone in our lovely flat and we had lots of ideas. There were three restrains which would decide our next destination: we wanted at least a three-week trip, it had to be pretty far away and exotic, and we needed to keep our budget low. With this in mind, and with a little help from our friend Ferran (who had visited some of the south-eastern countries), we finally chose the destination for our first big trip: Vietnam.

It took a surprisingly small amount of time for us to buy the flights. After a whole afternoon of googling, reading blogs and making use of the lonely planet guide, we saw there were three options which could be combined: north, center or southern Vietnam. We checked our calendars and we could fit a three-weeks trip and, after checking places to visit, we decided that we would do a centern-north trip, and leave the south for a future trip. Let me tell you that this was definately a great choice, since this way we were not on a rush and we were able to visit every place and enjoy every single minute. 

And that same day, just before our vegan pizza delivery guy arrived, we bought our plane tickets: Barcelona - Da Nang, and Da Nang - Barcelona. Sure, we had to buy an internal flight from Hanoi back to Da Nang, but it was worth it.
