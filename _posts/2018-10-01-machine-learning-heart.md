# About me

I don't know who - if any - will read this blog, but hi! Let me first introduce myself. My name is Jordi, I'm a guy from Barcelona who, one day during the 2020 pandemic, decided it was about damn time to create a blog! I've never been much of a blogger, I'm not really a good writter, and I don't have a crazy life with tons of stuff going on, but writting kind of helps me clear my mind, and I thought this way I could share and immortalize some of my best memories, along with other stuff I consider of interest.

And why github, you might be wondering? Because why not! I don't consider myself a "techie" or however you may want to call it, but I do have interests in programming, and whilst learning how to code with python, I discovered github, which can be useful for both my interests, and I prefer it this way. 

And I guess that's all about me! Here you can expect to find stuff related to programming (very basic), personal travel or train running. Maybe in the future I'll post stuff about other topics, but only if I feel confident about it. 

Welcome to my page!
